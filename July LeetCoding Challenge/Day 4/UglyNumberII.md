Write a program to find the  `n`-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are **positive numbers**  whose prime factors only include  `2, 3, 5`.

**Example:**
<pre>
<code>
<b>Input:</b> n = 10
<b>Output:</b> 12
<b>Explanation:</b> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first `10` ugly numbers.
</code>
</pre>
**Note:**

1.  `1`  is typically treated as an ugly number.
2.  `n`  **does not exceed 1690**.
